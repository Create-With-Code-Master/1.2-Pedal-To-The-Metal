<img class="overview-image" src="assets/images/screen-capture.png">

In this lesson you will add C# code to make your driving simulator come alive. Next you will add physics components to your vehicle and obstacle objects, allowing them to collide with one another. Then, you will learn how to duplicate objects in the hierarchy and position them along the road. Finally, you will commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
